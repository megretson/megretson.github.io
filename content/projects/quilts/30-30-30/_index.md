My participation in Var Gallery's 30 x 30 x 30 exhibit. 

My entry for the 2025 30x30x30 exhibition is a series of quilts. Each quilt is a traditional quilt block with images from that day printed onto fabric then appliqued on top.

The pieces were studies in contrast. By placing news headlines against quilts, it created a tension between public and private spheres. By rendering them in a time-consuming medium, I compared the fleeting attention provided to headlines against the sustained attention required for fiber work.

I also hoped the pieces would work together as a whole—-visually appearing like a larger quilt when placed together in the grid. My favorite entries to previous 30x30x30 exhibitions had all consider time as one of the mediums of the pieces: bodies of work that showed pieces of the artist’s day-to-day. By using headlines, I hoped my pieces would similarly be rooted in the time of their creation, providing a narrative throughline across the month.

The pieces serve as a time capsule of the opening of 2025. I hope the viewer will reflect on which of the news stories are recognizable to them, and how those events fit in the chronologies of their own Januarys.
