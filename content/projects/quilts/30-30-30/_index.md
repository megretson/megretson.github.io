A modern interpretation of a quilt made by my Great-Grandmother, stitched with every US State flower by my mother, my sister, and me. Given to my grandmother as gift for Christmas 2021. The quilt was begun October 2020, and completed November 2021. Each flower has is tagged with who embroidered it beneath the photo.
