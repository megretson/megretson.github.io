{{< figure src="julie_with_quilt.jpg" title="The final product" >}}

A modern interpretation of a quilt made by my Great-Grandmother, stitched with every US State flower by my mother, my sister, and me. Given to my grandmother as gift for Christmas 2021. The quilt was begun October 2020, and completed November 2021. Each individual quilt block is labeled with the state and flower on its detail page.
