 I made this quilt as a wedding present to friends. I officiated their wedding, and the embroidery is a quote reading "come woe, come weal, come what may." The color palette is from their wedding colors: green and pink. The pattern is [the Summer Solstice Quilt Pattern](https://www.alderwood-studio.com/shop/p/summersolstice-quilt-pattern) from Alderwood Studio. I had it professionally long-armed because I did not have access to a long-arm at the time. It felt less risky to make someone else's pattern, but ultimately I regret not using my own pattern for this.
