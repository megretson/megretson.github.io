This is a small quilt from a [purl soho pattern](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2014/05/08/mollys-sketchbook-crossroads-quilt/) called Crossroads. Quilt top is kona cotton fabric, the backing is a huge sheet of fabric found at a craft thrift store in Illinois. I ultimately gave it away t oisomeone who didn't server it, que sera!
