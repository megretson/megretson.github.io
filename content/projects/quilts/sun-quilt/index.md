This was an early improv quilt. I did it because I had gotten a new curved ruler and sometimes that's all it takes. Procedurally, I paired up fabric I liked, and then stitched them into half-moon shapes. I then cut down and arranged the blocks into a gradient. I overdyed all of these fabrics because I had a bunch of dye left over from summer tie dyeing. The back is ice dyed muslin.
