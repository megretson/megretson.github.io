I still love this quilt and ended up giving it to my friend Sam. It was done through a class at MIAD with [Mariah Tate Klemens](https://www.mariahtateklemens.com/bio). It was my first experience with improv quilting, and I loved it. I had never done reverse applique before. This is also a revisit of two previous quilts in a way: it incorporates men's button-downs, (including with curved hem going from their shirt tails and buttons) like from the oxford quilt, and the colored fabric is scraps from the state flower quilt.
