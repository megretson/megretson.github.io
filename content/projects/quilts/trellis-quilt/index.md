I love this quilt and I'm so proud of it. It was one of my first where I conceived of it the pattern and executed entirely from there. This quilt is strip pieced on an angle. It was so hard to quilt at that bias angle, and stretched and stretched. I would do it completely differently now, but it still lives with me because I love it. The concept was that it looks like a trellis with organic quilting growing up the quilt, originally sketched on graph and isodot paper. Growing up I used to love drawing ribbons, things that fold, so this was an extension of that as well. The color palette is from "The Dictionary of Color Combinations;" a tiny Japanese book just chock full of color mixes. 

There were a few early iterations of the quilt:

This quilt is also when I finally decided to try and actually, you know, photograph my work well:

I ended up taking photos of it on an annual friends' trip to a cabin; I swear I did not dress them for this photo but I did pose them
