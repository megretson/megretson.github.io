{{< figure src="on_porch.jpeg" title="A traded Kandinsky quilt" >}}

This is a quilt I made for a trade with a local jeweler. Him and his wife are both artists, and I made this quilt based on her pottery as a birthday present for him to give to her. She is a ceramicist, and this quilt is based on her ceramics work. He told me that her work is deeply inspired by Kandinsky, so I simplified some of Kandinsky's work and also took the color palette from one of her ceramics pieces. You can find here ceramics works [here](https://www.instagram.com/maryhughs_mudroom/). 

This is the piece the palette is taken from
