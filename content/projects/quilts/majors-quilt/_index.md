{{< figure src="tie_quilt_detail.jpeg" title="Detail of tie quilting in Major's shape" >}}

This was a whole-cloth quilt for my dog Major, made of a heavy denim and shirting to standup to his claws and being taken around town. To make it, I traced his shape on a piece of fabric while he way laying on it, and then tie quilted within his shape, echop-quilted around it. I enjoyed making it but didn't want to spend too much time on it as it was primarily functional.
