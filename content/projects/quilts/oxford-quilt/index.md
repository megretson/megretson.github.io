This was my first quilt, and I should really take a better photo of. It is twin size (which I have since learned is very ambitious), and it is made entirely out of scrap oxford shirts. They were all pulled from my closet, my dad's closet, and the local goodwill. It is a take on a quilt from the book _Modern Quilts_, so I also operated without a pattern here. You live and you learn, but I still love this quilt.
