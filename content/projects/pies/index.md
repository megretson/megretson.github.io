For 2021 I decided I wanted to intentionally improve a skill: pie crusts. And because I believe in shooting for the moon, I set the goal of making a pie a week. This worked out great through most of the winter. I had just moved to Milwaukee and the winter kept me inside, enjoying heating up my oven. Then Spring hit, and I switched to hiking trails rather than staying inside making pies! My rate is closer to a pie every _two_ weeks, but here are links to all of the pies I have made thus far!
