## about
My name is (Meg) Anderson. I am an Edison Engineer at GE Healthcare, a student, a scientist, and artist. I am an alumni of William & Mary, '20. 


## a disclaimer on my internet presence
All opinions expressed are (or were at one point) my own. My beliefs do not represent those of my employers. 

I have had internet access since age 10, and started posting shitty middle school hot-takes on facebook shortly thereafter. In retrospect, I had free reign across the internet _way_ too early. Thus, I disavow anything I posted more than 7 years ago as a rule.
