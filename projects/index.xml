For this project, I wrote a script with Wils McCreight to scrape github repositories in order to generate training data for the model. We ultimately scraped 5 million files each of python, java, C, and javascript. I then created a schema for the storage of these data artifacts, and created a mongo db to host these intermediate steps and an architecture for storing intermediate calculation steps / tokenization during model generation to allow for traceability of model generation.</description></item><item><title>Quarantine Gothic</title><link>https://megretson.github.io/projects/quarantine-gothic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://megretson.github.io/projects/quarantine-gothic/</guid><description>My final project for Gender, Sexuality, and Gaming.

Needless to say, computer animation did not end up being my passion. I do have an increased appreciation for anyone who does this, it feels like something for people who are a little insane.
project 1: solar system This was our first project, a little model of the solar system. It follows an intro maya tutorial.</description></item></channel></rss>
